A C program is said
to be strictly conforming to Standard C if that program uses only the features of the language
and library described in the Standard.

Conforming implementations may provide extensions that do not change the meaning
of any strictly conforming program. This allows implementations to add library routines
and define their own #pragma directives, but not to introduce new reserved
identifiers or change the operation of standard library functions.

When a compiler calculates the compile-time value of a constant expression
involving characters, it must use the target computer's encoding, not the more natural (to
the compiler writer) source encoding.
